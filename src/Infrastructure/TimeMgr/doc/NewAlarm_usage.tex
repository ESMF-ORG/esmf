NewAlarms are used in conjunction with Clocks (see Section~\ref{sec:Clock}).
Multiple NewAlarms can be associated with a Clock.  During the
{\tt ESMF\_ClockAdvance()} method, a Clock iterates over its internal NewAlarms
to determine if any are ringing.  NewAlarms ring when a specified NewAlarm 
time is reached or exceeded, taking into account whether the time step is
positive or negative.  In {\tt ESMF\_DIRECTION\_REVERSE}
(see Section~\ref{sec:Clock}), newalarms ring in reverse, i.e., they begin
ringing when they originally ended, and end ringing when they originally
began.  On completion of the time advance call, the Clock optionally returns
a list of ringing newalarms.

Each ringing NewAlarm can then be processed using NewAlarm methods for identifying,
turning off, disabling or resetting the NewAlarm.

NewAlarm methods are defined for obtaining the ringing state, turning the
ringer on/off, enabling/disabling the NewAlarm, and getting/setting 
associated times.

The following example shows how to set and process NewAlarms.
