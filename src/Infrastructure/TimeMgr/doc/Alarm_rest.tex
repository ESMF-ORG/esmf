\begin{enumerate}

\item {\bf Alarm list allocation factor}  The alarm list within a clock is
dynamically allocated automatically, 200 alarm references at a time.
This constant is defined in both Fortran and C++ with a \#define for ease
of modification.

\item {\bf Alarm ringInterval } The alarm ring interval must be greater
than or equal to clock time step. This is consistent with physical clock and
alarm behavior.

\item {\bf Alarm ring time} An alarm will only ring if its ring time matches
exactly the clock's current time.

\end{enumerate}
